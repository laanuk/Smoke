# Smoke

####Smoke is a Google Chrome extension that seamlessly and effortlessly enables users to mask & modify their browser history. 

The extension allows users to set a blacklist of urls that they would like removed or modified from their browser history without having to use 'Incognito Mode' or an alternate browser. On the backend, without any further work on behalf of the user, the extension is able to do three things with all browser history related to the blacklisted urls:

1) Erase them from browser history with no remaining traces of searches, cookies, or websites visited.

2) Modify blacklisted url searches to any designated url set by the user.

3) Modify blacklisted url searches to specific urls that can be extracted from other non-blacklisted, user work-related web pages that the user has open. This allows for browser history to look unmodified.

In addition, the extension is able to do this live as the user is generating browser history that needs to be modified, making it quick, efficient, and effortless for the user. No current application with this functionality exists.
